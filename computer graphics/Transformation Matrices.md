1. Scaling
2. Shearing
3. rotation
4. reflection
5. composition of the above linear operations
6. decomposition,
7. why deomcpose?
8. decomposition is useful to present a transformation to user for manipulation in terms  for separate rotations and scale factors,
9. how to decompose?
10. Symmetric Eigenvalue Decomposition
11. symmetric matrices are just scaling operations—albeit potentially nonuniform and non–axis-aligned ones.
12. Sigular value decompoitiono
13. Paeth Decomposition of Rotations
14. uses shears to represent nonzero rotations
15. the following are about 3-D transformation.
16. 3d rotation about the axis
17. Arbitrary 3D Rotations
18. key to arbitrary 3d rotation is that first we rotate the object from the u(the direction rotate about) and rotate the Z axis and rotate back to u
